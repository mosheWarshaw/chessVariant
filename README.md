&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the basis of this variant is the idea of pieces getting their value (their movement capabilities) from the cell
they land on. the purple cells transform the piece that was put into it into a different piece. kings and shields
are the only pieces that won't transform. there's a button that the user can use to see what piece it will be turned into.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are some other changes in this variant:
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-regarding new pieces, the shield is a piece that can move like the king but cannot kill. the prince (the crown without the cross) can move like a king regarding its ability to move in every direction, but unlike the king which moves one cell at a time, the prince jumps two cells at a time. the general (the napolean hat) moves like a prince and king. the bishop is not a new piece, but in addition to the way it moves in traditional chess it can
move like a king. there aren't knights or queens.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-regarding the board (aside from it being 11x11), the transparent corner cells cannot be moved to. the user cannot put a piece on any of them. they remain, though, to retain the shape of the board.
